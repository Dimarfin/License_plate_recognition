#License plate recognition system

This model implements detection the car license plate detection and recognition of the text on it.
It includes two main steps several steps depicted in the figure below:




The detection step is realized using [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) - object detection system base on a convolutional neuronal network. models pretrained
